## üì¶ Automated Releases & CurseForge Packaging

Our CI/CD pipeline is fully automated. Here‚Äôs how it works:

### How It Works

1. **Commit & Merge:**  
   Use Conventional Commit messages when pushing changes to `main`.

2. **Automated Versioning:**  
   Semantic-release analyzes your git history, bumps the version, and pushes a new tag (e.g., `v4.3.0`).

3. **CI/CD Workflow:**
    - **Testing & Linting:** The workflow runs Lua tests and lint checks.
    - **Building & Packaging:** The addon is built and packaged into a zip file.
    - **Uploading:** A Node.js script automatically uploads the packaged addon to CurseForge.

4. **Required Secrets:**  
   Ensure that your repository‚Äôs secrets include:
    - `GITHUB_TOKEN`
    - `NPM_TOKEN`
    - `CURSEFORGE_PROJECT_ID`
    - `CURSEFORGE_TOKEN`

No manual tagging is required‚Äîsimply merge your changes and push!

## üì¶ CI/CD & Release Pipeline

A comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow (see `.github/workflows/release.yml`) handles:

- Checkout of the full codebase.
- Installation of Node.js and dependencies.
- Running tests (e.g., `node cmdsage.js test`).
- Executing semantic-release on new tags.
- Updating the version in your TOC file.
- Building and packaging the addon as a zip file.
- Uploading the zip to CurseForge via a Node.js upload script.

Make sure your repository settings include the required secrets listed above.
